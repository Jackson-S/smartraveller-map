# smartraveller.gov.au Map Generator
### What is this?
This script takes data from smartraveller.gov.au and gets the overall travel advisory level for each country, then places all that into a pretty SVG file.
![If this link worked a pretty map would be here](sample.png?raw=true "Map Sample")

### Motivation
smartraveller.gov.au doesn't provide a world map, I thought it'd look cool. I thought right.

### Why Are Some Countries Grey?
Ask the Australian Government. It's their data.
