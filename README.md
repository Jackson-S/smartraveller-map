# smartraveller.gov.au Map Generator
### What is this?
This takes the images from smartraveller.gov.au and gets the average caution
level for that country, then places all that into a pretty SVG file.
![If this link worked a pretty map would be here](https://github.com/jackson-s/smartraveller-map/sample.svg)

### Motivation
I thought it'd look cool. I thought right.

### Why Are Some Countries Grey?
Ask the Australian Government. It's their data.

### This Takes Too Long To Run
Deal with it. It's not (at all) optimized or well thought out code.
